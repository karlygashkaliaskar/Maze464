# Maze464
This experiment will examine how efficiently people can learn to navigate two different types of mazes while multi-tasking with either of two types of auditory secondary tasks. 

•Create Mazes:
  	*Each maze will be accessible in egocentric and allocentric form
    *30 total mazes, each small and simple
  	*Mazes need unique noises at the beginning so they can be cross checked with the audio

•	Maze Specs(View from Directly Above):
   *Flashlight type field of view – they should only be able to see the corridor in front of them (see the game “DoorKickers” for an example – the only difference is the darker part of the screen in the game will be completely opaque in this experiment)
   *Can still look down corridors before turning 
   *Uses arrow keys to move, auto-advances forward at a set speed
   
•	Secondary Task – Audio Cues
   *Implemented by movement or location
   *There will be a list order so it will choose randomly without replacement from the list of audio files until the participant is put back at the beginning of a maze (the same or a different one)


Experimental Run Through:
Before the participant arrives, the research assistant will open the program and choose the parameters. For example, they may choose the first person maze view, the allocentric secondary task type, 10 attempts at each maze, and a 5 minute time out. It will bring up a consent screen and they’ll click the checkbox to provide consent to participate, and then the experiment will begin. An instructions screen will be presented, which the participant will read and then choose “next” to take them to the first maze. A message will appear that tells them they are about to see the first maze. They will go through the maze until the reach the end, at which point a message will appear saying something like “Congratulations, you’ve reached the end! You will now try the same maze again.” They’ll choose “Go” and will be brought back to the start of the maze. This will repeat until they have gone through the maze up to the time out. Once it times out, they will see a message that says something like “Congratulations, you’ve reached the end! Let’s move on to the next maze.” The next maze (randomly selected from the list of appropriate mazes as determined by the parameters chosen at the beginning) will appear and the process will repeat. Once they go through all the mazes, a message will appear notifying them that they are finished the mazes and there is a short survey. They will then be prompted to answer questions about their gender and video game usage. Once they submit those answers, a final message will say something like “You have finished the experiment. Please notify the research assistant. Thank you for your participation.” The data output will download in a csv file for the research assistant to save.
